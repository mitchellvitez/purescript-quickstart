# PureScript Elmish Quickstart

Surprisingly often, I find it helpful to build a mini web UI to solve problems. This repo provides a foundation for me to quickly throw one together.

## Usage

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then edit `src/Main.purs` and `style.css`

## Desiderata

- very fast to get a new app up and running
- autoreload and autorefresh
- just enough starter code to be able to copy from without going to docs
- boilerplate should get out of the way
- functional programming with nice types and high-level abstractions
- extremely simple application architecture
- all code in one file (except for CSS)
